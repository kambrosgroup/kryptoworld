# Affiliate Disclosure

## Our Commitment to Transparency

KryptoWorld participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn commissions when you click on certain links and make purchases or sign up for services.

## How It Works

- We recommend products and services we have personally tested or thoroughly researched
- Affiliate relationships do not influence our reviews or recommendations
- We do not accept payment for positive reviews
- Our opinions are our own

## What This Means for You

- You pay the same price whether you use our affiliate links or go directly
- We may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you
- Using our links helps support our work and allows us to create more free content

## Current Affiliate Partners

We currently have affiliate relationships with:

- Cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and others)
- Hardware wallet manufacturers (Ledger, Trezor)
- Crypto tax software providers
- Other crypto-related services

## Our Review Process

5. **Updates:** We regularly update reviews as things change
