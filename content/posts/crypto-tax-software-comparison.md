Tax season is crypto investors' least favorite time of year. If you've traded on multiple exchanges, used DeFi protocols, or received airdrops, your tax situation is... complicated.

The good news: crypto tax software can automate most of the work. The bad news: choosing the wrong one costs you time and money.

I've tested the three most popular options. Here's what actually matters.

## Why You Need Crypto Tax Software

**Manual tracking is impossible.** If you've made:
- 100+ trades across 3 exchanges
- DeFi yield farming transactions
- NFT purchases/sales
- Staking rewards
- Airdrops

...a spreadsheet won't cut it. You'll miss transactions, miscalculate cost basis, and potentially underreport (or overreport) gains.

**Penalties are real.** The IRS (and other tax agencies) is increasingly focused on crypto. Underreporting can trigger audits, penalties, and interest.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Koinly | CoinLedger | TokenTax |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Free plan** | ✅ Yes (limited) | ✅ Yes (limited) | ❌ No |
| **Price (paid)** | $49–$279 | $49–$299 | $65–$3,499 |
| **Exchanges supported** | 400+ | 400+ | 120+ |
| **DeFi support** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Excellent |
| **NFT support** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Tax loss harvesting** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **CPA review** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (premium) |

## Koinly: The All-Rounder

Koinly is the most popular crypto tax software for good reason. It strikes the best balance of features, price, and ease of use.

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Track only, no tax reports |
| **Newbie** | $49/year | 100 transactions |
| **Hodler** | $99/year | 1,000 transactions |
| **Trader** | $179/year | 3,000 transactions |
| **Pro** | $279/year | 10,000+ transactions |

### What Koinly Does Well

**Exchange integrations:** 400+ exchanges and wallets. If it exists, Koinly probably supports it.

**DeFi support:** Automatic tracking of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, and most major protocols.

**NFT support:** Tracks Ethereum and Polygon NFTs automatically.

**Tax optimization:** Identifies tax loss harvesting opportunities.

**Multiple cost basis methods:** FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, and average cost.

### Koinly Downsides

- Free plan doesn't generate tax reports (just tracks)
- Customer support can be slow during tax season
- Some DeFi protocols require manual entry

### Who Should Use Koinly

Most crypto investors. If you're not sure which to pick, start with Koinly.

## CoinLedger: The Budget Option

CoinLedger (formerly CryptoTrader.Tax) offers similar features to Koinly at slightly lower prices.

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Track only |
| **Basic** | $49/year | 100 transactions |
| **Premium** | $99/year | 1,000 transactions |
| **Pro** | $199/year | 10,000 transactions |
| **Unlimited** | $299/year | Unlimited |

### What CoinLedger Does Well

**Price:** Slightly cheaper than Koinly for high-volume traders.

**TurboTax integration:** Direct import into TurboTax (US users).

**Error reconciliation:** Good tools for finding and fixing import errors.

### CoinLedger Downsides

- Fewer DeFi protocols supported than Koinly
- No tax loss harvesting feature
- Interface feels dated compared to Koinly

### Who Should Use CoinLedger

Budget-conscious users who primarily use centralized exchanges and don't need advanced DeFi tracking.

## TokenTax: The Premium Option

TokenTax is the most expensive option but offers features the others don't—especially for complex situations.

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | $65/year | 5,000 transactions |
| **Premium** | $199/year | 20,000 transactions |
| **Pro** | $799/year | Unlimited + DeFi/NFT |
| **VIP** | $3,499/year | Everything + CPA review |

### What TokenTax Does Well

**CPA review:** The VIP plan includes review by a crypto tax professional. Worth it if you have $100K+ in gains.

**Complex situations:** Best support for margin trading, futures, and sophisticated DeFi strategies.

**Audit defense:** Provides documentation and support if you're audited.

### TokenTax Downsides

- Expensive (3-10x more than competitors)
- Overkill for most users
- Fewer exchange integrations than Koinly

### Who Should Use TokenTax

High-net-worth individuals, professional traders, or anyone facing a complex tax situation worth $3,500+ to resolve correctly.

## How Crypto Tax Software Works

1. **Connect exchanges** via API or upload CSV files
2. **Connect wallets** using public addresses
3. **Review transactions** for accuracy
4. **Generate tax reports** (Form 8949, Schedule D, etc.)
5. **File or give to your accountant**

**Time required:** 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on complexity.

## Step-by-Step: Using Koinly

1. **Sign up** at koinly.io
2. **Add wallets/exchanges**
   - Use API keys for exchanges (read-only permissions)
   - Enter wallet addresses for blockchain tracking
3. **Review imported data**
   - Check for missing transactions
   - Verify cost basis looks correct
4. **Generate tax report**
   - Select your country
   - Choose tax year
   - Download forms
5. **File your taxes**
   - Import to TurboTax/TaxAct, or
   - Give to your accountant, or
   - File manually

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Transactions

**Problem:** Some transactions didn't import.

**Solution:** Most software lets you add manual transactions. Keep a spreadsheet backup of all your exchange exports.

### Wrong Cost Basis

**Problem:** Software shows gains/losses that don't match your records.

**Solution:** Check your cost basis method (FIFO is default). Make sure all transfers between your own wallets are marked correctly (not taxable events).

### DeFi Transactions Not Importing

**Problem:** Yield farming, staking, or liquidity pool transactions missing.

**Solution:** Enter your wallet addresses, not just exchange APIs. Some protocols require manual CSV uploads.

## Tax Tips for Crypto Investors

### 1. Track Everything

Every trade, every airdrop, every staking reward is a taxable event. The software only works if you give it complete data.

### 2. Understand Cost Basis

**FIFO (First In, First Out):** Oldest coins sold first. Usually results in higher gains (more tax).

**LIFO (Last In, First Out):** Newest coins sold first. Can reduce taxes in rising markets.

**HIFO (Highest In, First Out):** Highest cost basis sold first. Usually minimizes taxes.

Most software lets you choose. Consult a tax professional for your situation.

### 3. Harvest Tax Losses

Sell losing positions to offset gains. You can buy back after 30 days (wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto... yet).

Koinly and TokenTax identify loss harvesting opportunities automatically.

### 4. Keep Records

Save your tax reports forever. The IRS can audit up to 6 years back. Crypto tax software keeps records, but have backups.

## International Users

**US:** All three support IRS forms (8949, Schedule D).

**UK:** Koinly and CoinLedger support HMRC reporting.

**Canada:** Koinly supports CRA reporting.

**Australia:** Koinly supports ATO reporting.

**EU:** Koinly supports most EU countries.

Check each software's supported countries before committing.

## The Bottom Line

**For most users:** Koinly offers the best balance of features and price.

**For simple situations:** CoinLedger saves a few dollars.

**For complex/high-value situations:** TokenTax's CPA review might pay for itself.

The cost of tax software ($50–$300) is trivial compared to the time saved and potential penalties avoided.
