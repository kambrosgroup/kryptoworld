Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), it grew from a startup to a behemoth handling billions in daily trades.

But bigger isn't always better. Let's examine whether Binance deserves its throne—or your business.

## The Numbers That Matter

- **Daily Volume:** $50+ billion
- **Users:** 150+ million worldwide
- **Coins Listed:** 350+
- **Countries:** 100+ (with restrictions)
- **Fees:** 0.1% (lowest in industry)

## Binance Fees: The Clear Winner

If low fees are your priority, Binance is unbeatable.

### Trading Fees

| Level | Maker | Taker |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **VIP 0** | 0.1% | 0.1% |
| **VIP 1** | 0.09% | 0.1% |
| **VIP 5** | 0.06% | 0.07% |
| **With BNB** | 0.02% | 0.02% |

**Comparison:**
- Coinbase Advanced: 0.0–0.6%
- Kraken Pro: 0.16–0.26%
- Binance: 0.02–0.1%

**Example:** A $10,000 trade costs:
- Coinbase: $0–$60
- Kraken: $16–$26
- Binance: $2–$10

### Deposit/Withdrawal Fees

**Crypto deposits:** Free
**Crypto withdrawals:** Varies by coin (Bitcoin ~0.0005 BTC)
**Fiat deposits:** Free–3.5% depending on method
**Fiat withdrawals:** $1–$15 depending on method

## Features That Set Binance Apart

### 1. Massive Coin Selection

350+ cryptocurrencies listed. If it has any market cap, Binance probably lists it.

**Categories:**
- Major coins (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- DeFi tokens (UNI, AAVE, COMP)
- Gaming/NFT (SAND, MANA, AXS)
- Layer 2 (MATIC, ARB, OP)
- Meme coins (DOGE, SHIB, PEPE)

### 2. Binance Earn

Passive income options:
- **Simple Earn:** 1–10% APY on 100+ assets
- **Staking:** 3–20% APY
- **Dual Investment:** Up to 300% APY (structured products)
- **Liquidity Farming:** Varies by pool

### 3. Binance Launchpad

Token sale platform. Past launches include:
- Axie Infinity (AXS)
- Polygon (MATIC)
- The Sandbox (SAND)

Early participants saw 10–100x returns. But past performance ≠ future results.

### 4. Binance NFT Marketplace

Buy, sell, and create NFTs. Lower fees than OpenSea (2.5% vs 2.5% + gas).

### 5. Binance Pay

Send crypto to friends or pay merchants. Like Venmo, but for crypto.

### 6. Binance Card

Spend crypto anywhere Visa is accepted. 0–8% cashback in BNB.

## The Regulatory Cloud

Binance's biggest weakness: regulatory challenges.

**2023–2024 Issues:**
- CZ stepped down as CEO (pleaded guilty to US charges)
- $4.3 billion US fine (largest in crypto history)
- Withdrawal restrictions in some countries
- Banking partner issues

**Current Status:**
- New CEO Richard Teng (former regulator)
- Compliance overhaul in progress
- Most services restored
- Still restricted in some US states

**The risk:** Future regulatory actions could affect withdrawals or trading.

## Security: Mixed Record

### The Good
- SAFU fund ($1 billion insurance)
- 2FA required
- Address whitelist
- Withdrawal confirmations
- Real-time monitoring

### The Bad
- 2019 hack ($40 million stolen, covered by SAFU)
- Regulatory scrutiny
- No FDIC/SIPC insurance

### The Reality
Binance has never lost user funds permanently. The SAFU fund covered the 2019 hack completely. But the regulatory pressure creates uncertainty.

## Who Should Use Binance?

### Use Binance If:
- You want the lowest fees
- You trade frequently
- You want access to altcoins
- You're comfortable with some regulatory risk
- You're outside the US (or in supported states)

### Skip Binance If:
- You prioritize regulatory compliance above all
- You're in a restricted jurisdiction

- Large amounts make you nervous on any single exchange

## Step-by-Step: Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at binance.com
2. **Complete KYC** (ID + selfie + proof of address)
3. **Enable 2FA** (Google Authenticator recommended)
4. **Deposit funds**
   - Crypto: Send from another wallet
   - Fiat: Bank transfer, card, or P2P
5. **Start trading**
   - Convert: Simple swaps
   - Spot: Limit/market orders
   - Advanced: Margin, futures (high risk!)

## Binance.US vs Binance.com

**Binance.US** is a separate, smaller exchange for American users:
- 150+ coins (vs 350+)
- Higher fees
- More regulatory compliance
- Available in most US states

If you're in the US, use Binance.US unless you're in a restricted state (NY, TX, VT, etc.).

## The Verdict

Binance offers unmatched features and the lowest fees. But you pay for that with regulatory uncertainty.

**Rating: 4.3/5**

- Fees: 5/5
- Features: 5/5
- Security: 4/5
- Regulation: 3/5
- Support: 4/5

**My take:** Use Binance for trading altcoins and earning yield. But don't keep your entire portfolio there—diversify across exchanges and self-custody wallets.

The crypto mantra applies: not your keys, not your coins. Binance is excellent for trading, but withdraw to your own wallet for long-term storage.
