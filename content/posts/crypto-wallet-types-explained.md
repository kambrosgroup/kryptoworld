"Not your keys, not your coins."

You'll hear this phrase constantly in crypto circles. It sounds cryptic, but it's actually simple: if you don't control the private keys to your crypto, you don't really own it.

This guide explains your storage options—from leaving crypto on exchanges (convenient but risky) to hardware wallets (secure but cost money). By the end, you'll know exactly how to store your crypto based on how much you own and your risk tolerance.

## The Storage Spectrum

Think of crypto storage like cash:

- **Exchange** = Bank (they hold it, you trust them)
- **Hot wallet** = Wallet in your pocket (convenient, could be stolen)
- **Cold wallet** = Safe at home (secure, takes effort to access)

Each has its place. Let's break them down.

## Exchange Storage: Convenient but Risky

**What it is:** Leaving your crypto on Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, or any other exchange.

**Best for:** Small amounts ($500 or less), active traders

**How it works:** The exchange holds your private keys. You log in with a username and password. They control the crypto; you have an IOU.

### Pros
- ✅ Easiest option—no setup required
- ✅ Instant trades
- ✅ Customer support if you forget your password
- ✅ Often insured against hacks (read the fine print)

### Cons
- ❌ Exchange can be hacked (happened to Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, others)
- ❌ Exchange can freeze your account
- ❌ Exchange can go bankrupt (see: FTX)
- ❌ You don't actually control your crypto

### My Take

Leaving crypto on an exchange is like keeping cash in a bank. For day-to-day amounts, it's fine. But would you keep your life savings in a checking account? Probably not.

**Rule of thumb:** Keep on exchange what you'd keep in a checking account. Move the rest to your own wallet.

## Hot Wallets: Convenience with Control

**What it is:** Software wallets on your phone or computer. You control the private keys.

**Best for:** $500-5,000, regular transactions, DeFi users

**How it works:** The wallet app generates and stores your private keys on your device. You get a "recovery phrase" (12-24 words) that can restore your wallet anywhere.

### Popular Hot Wallets

| Wallet | Type | Best For | Platforms |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Exodus** | Multi-coin | Beginners | Desktop, Mobile |
| **MetaMask** | Ethereum/EVM | DeFi users | Browser, Mobile |
| **BlueWallet** | Bitcoin | Bitcoin-only | Mobile |
| **Electrum** | Bitcoin | Advanced users | Desktop |
| **Trust Wallet** | Multi-coin | Binance users | Mobile |

### Pros
- ✅ You control your private keys
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ✅ Good for regular transactions
- ✅ Access to DeFi and dApps

### Cons
- ❌ Vulnerable to malware and hacks
- ❌ Phone/computer theft = potential loss
- ❌ No customer support if you mess up
- ❌ Recovery phrase responsibility

### Critical: Your Recovery Phrase

When you set up a hot wallet, you get 12 or 24 words. This is your **recovery phrase** (also called seed phrase).

**Write it down. On paper. Store it somewhere safe.**

If your phone dies, you lose your recovery phrase, and you lose your crypto. Forever. No password reset. No customer service. Gone.

**Never:**
- Screenshot your recovery phrase
- Store it in cloud storage
- Email it to yourself
- Share it with anyone

## Cold Wallets: Maximum Security

**What it is:** Hardware devices that store private keys offline. The gold standard for security.

**Best for:** $5,000+, long-term holders, security-conscious users

**How it works:** The hardware wallet generates and stores keys on the device itself. It never connects to the internet. When you want to send crypto, you connect the device, confirm the transaction on its screen, and disconnect.

### Popular Hardware Wallets

| Wallet | Price | Best For | Screen |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Ledger Nano S Plus** | ~$79 | Beginners | Small |
| **Ledger Nano X** | ~$149 | Mobile users | Small |
| **Trezor Model One** | ~$69 | Budget option | Monochrome |
| **Trezor Model T** | ~$179 | Premium option | Color touchscreen |
| **BitBox02** | ~$120 | Bitcoin focus | Minimal |

</div>

### Pros
- ✅ Private keys never touch the internet
- ✅ Immune to computer malware
- ✅ Can recover funds even if device breaks (using recovery phrase)
- ✅ Best security available

### Cons
- ❌ Costs money ($50-200)
- ❌ Physical device to keep track of
- ❌ Slower for frequent transactions
- ❌ Still need to protect recovery phrase

### How Hardware Wallets Work

1. **Set up:** Connect device, create PIN, write down recovery phrase
2. **Receive:** Get addresses from device, send crypto to them
3. **Store:** Disconnect device, store safely
4. **Send:** Connect device, confirm transaction on device screen

The key: **transactions are signed on the device, not your computer.** Even if your computer is infected with malware, it can't steal your crypto because the private keys never leave the hardware wallet.

## Which Should You Choose?

| Amount | Recommended Storage | Why |
|--------|---------------------|-----|
| **$0-500** | Exchange | Not worth wallet complexity |
| **$500-2,000** | Hot wallet | Free, you control keys |
| **$2,000-5,000** | Hot wallet + considering hardware | Start planning for hardware |
| **$5,000+** | Hardware wallet | Security worth the cost |
| **$50,000+** | Hardware wallet + multisig | Multiple devices, extra security |

## Setting Up Your First Wallet

### Hot Wallet Setup (Exodus Example)

1. Download Exodus from exodus.com (verify URL!)
2. Install and open the app
3. Write down your 12-word recovery phrase
4. Confirm you've written it down
5. Start receiving crypto

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Cost:** Free

### Hardware Wallet Setup (Ledger Example)

1. Buy from official Ledger store (never buy used!)
2. Download Ledger Live software
3. Connect device, create PIN
4. Write down 24-word recovery phrase
5. Verify recovery phrase on device
6. Install apps for coins you want to store

**Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Cost:** $79-149

## Common Wallet Mistakes

### ❌ Buying Hardware Wallets from Amazon/eBay

Scammers buy devices, extract the recovery phrase, repackage, and sell. When you add funds, they drain it. Only buy from official manufacturer websites.

### ❌ Not Testing Recovery

Before moving significant funds, test your recovery phrase. Wipe the device (or use a second device) and restore from your phrase. If it works, you're good. If not, you caught the problem early.

### ❌ Storing Recovery Phrase Digitally

A photo on your phone. A note in your email. A file in Dropbox. All of these are vulnerable to hacks. Paper. In a safe place. That's it.

### ❌ Sharing Recovery Phrase

Nobody legitimate will ever ask for your recovery phrase. Support teams, "tech support," random DMs—they're all scammers. Your phrase = your crypto. Guard it.

## Advanced: Multisig Wallets

For very large amounts ($100K+), consider multisignature (multisig) wallets. These require multiple keys to authorize a transaction.

Examples:
- 2-of-3: Need 2 keys out of 3 to spend
- 3-of-5: Need 3 keys out of 5 to spend

**Use case:** Store keys in different locations. Even if one is compromised, funds are safe.

**Complexity:** High. Don't attempt until you deeply understand single-signature wallets.

## The Bottom Line

Your storage choice should match your holdings:

- **Small amounts:** Exchange is fine
- **Medium amounts:** Hot wallet (free, convenient)
- **Large amounts:** Hardware wallet (secure, worth the cost)

The most important thing isn't which wallet you choose—it's that you:
1. Write down your recovery phrase
2. Store it safely
3. Never share it

Do those three things, and you're ahead of 90% of crypto users.
